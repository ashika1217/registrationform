# registrationform

 I am create the basic structure of the registration form with the necessary input fields for the name, email, ID, and password.
The validateForm() function checks for errors in each field:
Name: Checks if the name field is empty.
Email: Uses a regular expression to verify that the email is in the correct format.
ID: Ensures the ID is alphanumeric.
Password: Checks if the password is at least 6 characters long.
If there are any validation errors, they are displayed in the errorMessages div, and the form submission is prevented by returning false.
If all fields are valid, the form is submitted normally (though this can be adjusted depending on what you want to do after validation).
